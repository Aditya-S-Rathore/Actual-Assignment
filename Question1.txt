Q1. Mathematical question
We have an education product which is being used in the class. For a class of 30 students, what’s the defect frequency target per typical user session (say over a 10 minutes period) for the class if we aim for 90% defect-free rate for the entire class? All students are assumed to use the product the same way in their user session.
SOLUTION:
P = probability that the entire class is defect-free = 0.90.
p = probability that a single student’s session is defect-free.
n = number of students = 30.


For the entire class to be defect-free, all individual sessions must be defect-free. So, the probability for the entire class to be defect-free is the product of each student's defect-free probability:                                    P=p^n=0.9
=>    0.9=p^30
=>    ln(0.90)=30ln(p)
=>    p=0.9966
So, the defect-free probability per student is about 99.66%. The probability of a defect occurring in a single student's session is:      1-0.9966=0.0034
ANS=0.0034 or 0.34%
